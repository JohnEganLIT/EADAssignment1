## Enterprise Application Development - Assignment 1

This project was developed to satisfy the following spec:

Crazy Clown Airlines Fly (return) to fifteen transatlantic destinations once a month from the Coonagh
airfield in Limerick. Each route is served by a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which can seat 335 passengers.
The passenger and route information is stored within a table called passengers in a database called
routes. I have provided a SQL script for this database.

1. Display the information from the database table neatly in a HTML table within the browser
(this is to be the home page for the application). You must display the flag provided for each
city/destination when outputting this information. As well as that, each row in your HTML
table must include an “Edit Link”. The first and last row of the HTML table must be
highlighted in grey (#DCDCDC)

2. Once a particular route has been selected for editing (i.e. by clicking on its associated edit
link), a form is to be displayed. The form is to contain prepopulated information about the
selected route. The user is then permitted to edit the displayed information (assume that they cannot edit
the flag/image for a particular route or its three letter airport code). Once the user submits the form, any edits made should be made persistent on the database.
The user should then be returned to the applications home page.

3. You must display the number of routes returned from the database at the top of your
homepage.

4. You must use a CSS style sheet across all your JSP’s – consider using the one I have provided.

### Note

1. Solution must be 100% MVC compliant.
2. Must use JPA.
3. Must use Tomcat as your target Server.
4. Only submissions from students who are in class will be accepted.
